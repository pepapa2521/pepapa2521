# Hello there !

My name is Alejandro PÃ©rez Web developer with skills in Laravel, PHP, and creating attractive interfaces using Nuxt.js and Vuetify. Expert in HTML and CSS for modern and responsive web design. Knowledge of MySQL and SQL for databases. Applying SEO strategies to optimize the indexing and positioning of the projects in which I participated.

##  About Me
I have been in the world of web development and programming around 2007 and during this time, I have had the opportunity to participate in various projects in different leading companies in their field such as: web and application development, hospitality and tourist activities.


In all of these I have started, as in most times in life, from a basic level and over time I rose in level to become a Senior dev. In the same way, I have been advancing with technology, I have been adapting it to projects to improve the performance and productivity of the sites.


I am grateful to be working in those that I like and that sometimes it also blows my mind for reaching a point of frustration, of little progress in a project, but hey everything has a solution with due patience and determination. Never giving up, always looking for the right solution.
